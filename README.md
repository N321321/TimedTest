# TimedTest
This was a timed test, to build something from scratch within a set time. 
This just loads and displays some data of branches of restaurants using a link to some json.

The Task

We would like you to create a simple iOS application in Swift. The function of this app is to pull a feed of restaurants from an endpoint, show them as pins on a mapview integration of your choosing display a details screen for them.
Requirements:
- iOS application written in Swift using Xcode. Recent versions of both.
- Must support iOS 9.0 and above.
- iPad support is not required.
- The app must display a map view with a pin for each location in the JSON feed using
latitude and longitude from the feed.
- Once a pin is tapped itâ€™s popup should show the restaurant name from the feed.
- The pin popup should contain a button linking to a separate details screen.
- Thedetailsscreenshouldshowtherestaurant name, body and a linkout to the
delivery_link url if available.
- You are allowed to use any 3rd party libraries you prefer. Cocoapods is preferred.
- The restaurants should be cached for offline support.
- Spend a maximum of 4 hours on the task, even if it is not complete. Code structure
is more important than a finished but rushed project.
